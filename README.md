### Hello there 👋

I'm Ryan Harvey, a neuroscientist with an interest in data analysis/visualization and analytical tool development.

- [This](https://ryanharvey1.github.io/) is my website.
- I'm currently a postdoc in [Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz & Azahara Oliva](https://braincomputation.org/)'s lab at Cornell University, where I use analytical tools to investigate how the hippocampus encodes memories, with emphasis on its unique cellular diversity and connections. 🧠
- Before joining Cornell, I completed my PhD at the University of New Mexico, where I gained experience in data analysis, pipeline development, and visualization techniques. 👨‍💻
- Here's a list of my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3aAH9kEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
